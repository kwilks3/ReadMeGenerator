# README Generator

## Description

Create a README using this quick and easy CLI. Input the information requested by the prompts and the README will be generated for you. Check out the demo video below in the usage section! An example readme is in the example.md file.

Note: The README will be generated with the title README.md but I changed the name of that file.

The line below will automatically link to your GitHub respository once you provide your username!
